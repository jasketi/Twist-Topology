# Twist-Topological Framework (σ-Lock / TwistX)

This repository contains:

- the generic `twistlab` Python package with σ-Lock, TwistX and related algorithms;
- paper-specific code and notebooks for several manuscripts:
  - Episodic σ-Locks and Topological Stability in Animal Movement
  - Decay, Drift and Non–Orientable Loops
  - Reality as Lock
  - Sigma-Lock and Twist Topology in Dynamical Systems
  - Toward a Twist-Topological Account of Self-Organization
  - Periodic Self-Stabilization of DNA Activity Reveals a Geometric Feedback Between Structure and Function
